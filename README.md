# Code-Quiz-New

As a user I am taking a coding quiz that is timed.

WHEN the start button is clicked, the timer begins at 90 seconds and I am presented with the first question of the quiz. 

WHEN I answer a question I am prompted with an alert to tell me if my chosen answer is correct or wrong. 

If my answer is correct, my time continues to countdown and I am presented with the next question. 

If my chosen answer is incorrect, 15 seconds is deducted from my time, and I am presented with the next question.

WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0 then the game is over.

WHEN the game is over then I can save my initials and score. 

Then the app displays my saved highscores.
